## Architectural decision records

### Consistency with `vim.keymap`

The Keymaster module (`keymaster`) purposefully has an interface consistent
with `vim.keymap`:

- This allows people to use `keymaster` whenever they would use `vim.keymap`
  freely, decreasing the costs to change.
- Plugin can use dependency injection for `vim.keymap` and clients can provide
  `keymaster` when they wish for that extra power.

### Not reusing Neovim‚Äôs event bus

Neovim comes with its own event and observer mechanism using autocmd. This
plugin doesn‚Äôt reuse it, because that event bus is a global singleton.
It‚Äôs impossible to implement that kind of private passing of events like this
plugin does for `keymaster.add_lazy_load_observer` with it. It‚Äôs also harder to
test.
